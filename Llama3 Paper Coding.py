1. If your input includes any information related to hardware or devices, please list them.
2. Please ensure that the sentences provided are directly related to hardware, but there is no need to express this association in the output.
3. The current task is to enable the model to determine whether the sentence is related to hardware. If it is, please respond with "Yes"; if not, respond with "No".
4. All the sentences provided in this task are excerpts from a research paper.

Is there any sentence related to hardware? If yes, please list all the sentences directly without any additional comments or summaries.
Here are some examples:
* Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) have the potential to significantly expand the display space, enabling immersive entertainment and workspaces that go beyond the physical limitations of the car interior.
* Problematically, VR HMDs also occlude visual perception of reality [44, 6] and thus the carâ€™s motion, and are likely to lead to sensory mismatch and, consequently, motion sickness.
* However, assuming the orientation and velocity of the vehicle can be tracked at low latency, HMDs have the potential to portray the vehicle motion virtually.
Please only output sentences directly related to hardware. Do not include any additional comments or summaries. If the sentence is not related to hardware, do not output anything.
