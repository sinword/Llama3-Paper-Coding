We examined the use of VR HMDs in-motion through an in-car study of passengers wearing VR HMDs watching 360° VR video content as they were driven around a city

We could recreate an ecologically valid driving experience, of particular relevance to autonomous cars and public transport, and examine the effects of real-world motion cues, speciﬁcally rotations and accelerations/decelerations, over a set route.

• Our aims were to examine: • VR HMDs where all rotations affect VR viewing orienta- tion, regardless of whether they occurred through user head movements or vehicle motion; • Future positionally-tracked VR HMDs that can compensate, correct for or ignore external vehicle rotation; • The utility of peripheral visual motion cues to give some sense of external vehicle motion

Six conditions were deﬁned for the hardware components that would be used in the system.

They evaluated the effect of providing a stable VR view relative to car motion (contrasting current VR HMDs in-motion and future VR HMDs that could ignore vehicle motion), and of re-incorporating some perception of vehicle motion through mid-peripheral vision.

VR video and (2) motion only

Users were stationary, wearing a VR HMD, watching 360° video

The simulator was set up with only the motion component turned on to create a baseline condition for measuring simulator sickness.

The headset's lack of immersion was likely due to its low resolution and refresh rate, which may have caused a sense of bluriness and reduced overall image quality.

This gave a baseline for motion sickness from just being driven in a car; 3: VR Motion Environment In-motion, wearing a VR HMD.

The motion of the car was synchronously portrayed in VR, with the HMD user perceiving themselves moving through a basic landscape

4: VR V+M In-motion, wearing a VR HMD, with all rotations (head movements and vehicle rotations) interpreted as head movements

This conveyed turning of the car; 5: VR V+M with compensation In-motion, wearing a VR HMD, with compensatory rotations of the video counteracting vehicle rotations

6: VR V+M with peripheral feedback

The head-mounted display's (HMD) latency and resolution were adjusted to optimize its performance for this study.

The control system's output was connected to a DC motor driver chip which controlled the motor's speed and direction by adjusting the current flowing through it.

Implementation For the VR HMD, we used a Samsung Gear VR mobile HMD (SM-R322, 310 grams, 96° FOV, see Figure 1) paired with a Samsung S7 smartphone (VR framework version 11, service 1To see how conditions operated in-motion, view the attached video

version 2.4.29, 60Hz)

To have the capability to both convey the motions of the car in VR, and counteract the rotations of the car, a Nexus 5 smartphone was used.

It was mounted to the car, with its gyroscope (sampled at 30Hz at a latency of ⇠40ms) providing bearing changes

It was also paired with an OBD2 device (OBDLink LX [72], ⇠14Hz at a latency of 100ms) for capturing car velocity in real-time

For communi- cating the car motion to the HMD, we used a SocketIO server over which both the Nexus 5 and S7-powered HMD communicated

The study was conducted in a 2015 model Vauxhall Insignia, chosen both to minimize oscillations (through a modern suspension system) and provide a fast OBD2 link.

I apologize, but it seems you didn't provide a sentence related to hardware. Please provide one and I'll be happy to assist!

Firstly, we created a mo- tion environment synchronized to the car motion.

An initial gyroscope bearing was taken with users looking straight ahead whilst wearing the headset

Here is the sentence:

Subsequent changes in this bearing determined the direction of the forward vector in the motion environment, with velocity also portrayed.

Secondly, we stabilized the VR view with respect to car motion

Given the black box sensor fusion of the VR HMD tracking, we chose to exploit the fact that 360° VR video is typically rendered on a sphere, using gyroscope readings to perform counter-rotations of the sphere

Pilot testing showed that readings taken every second frame, combined with linear interpolation to smooth transitions, provided the most comfortable and accurate counter-rotation, accounting for variance in the gyroscope readings.

Thirdly, we blended the stabilized video content and the motion environment for the peripheral motion cues.

For this we used a shader effect combined with raycasting to determine the current video fixation point, with alpha blending to combine the motion environment and the video.

It is important to note that this approach, whilst suited to a prototype system, had some drawbacks regarding gyroscope drift.

A gyroscope is subject to drift over time and motion

In the case of the Gear VR, a combination of gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer are used to retain a relatively accurate bearing.

However, magnetometer readings are unreliable in-motion, due to variances in the magnetic field and the environment

This is not a sentence related to hardware.

We designed a mechanism to allow users to re-orient the system, taking a new bearing for the forward vector and resetting the Gear VR tracking.

To do this, users interacted with the Gear VR touchpad, located on the right side of the headset

If any desynchronization was perceived, they were to look straight ahead and swipe upwards with their dominant hand.

The VR headset's refresh rate was set to 60 Hz, which meant that the display would update 60 times per second.
