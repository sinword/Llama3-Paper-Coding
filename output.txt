Immersive HMDs are becoming everyday consumer items and, as they offer new possibilities for entertainment and productivity, people will want to use them during travel in, for example, autonomous cars.

Whilst VR HMDs restrict visual perception of motion, they could also render it virtually, potentially alleviating sensory conﬂict.

To study this problem, we conducted the ﬁrst on-road and in motion study to systematically investigate the effects of various visual presentations of the real-world motion of a car on the sickness and immersion of VR HMD wearing passengers.

While autonomous cars will allow for radical redesign of the car interior (e.g.

Consideration needs to be given to how entertainment and productivity can be supported whilst minimizing motion sickness.

Problematically, VR HMDs also occlude visual perception of reality [44, 6] and thus the car’s motion, and are likely to lead to sensory mismatch and, consequently, motion sickness.

However, assuming the orientation and velocity of the vehicle can be tracked at low latency, HMDs have the potential to portray the vehicle motion virtually.

VR and AR HMDs are capable of conveying the motion of the vehicle at all times, from all viewing angles.

Consequently, the problem is then: how should these Interactions in Virtual Reality CHI 2017, May 6–11, 2017, Denver, CO, USA 5655 dynamic and unpredictable physical motions be visually presented, and how can they be integrated into any virtual scene without reducing the immersion of the VR content.

This paper examines VR HMD use in-car, in-motion for the ﬁrst time.

We examine this both for existing consumer VR HMDs that interpret rotations of the car as rotations of the HMD, and future positionally-tracked HMDs that do not.

New baselines for VR motion sickness in-car are established and guidelines for future experimentation are provided, before we ﬁnally explore the further research required to enable comfortable VR HMD use in-motion.

describes as motion-sensitive input signals [3].

Lateral (bumps and undulations in a car ride) and vertical oscillations (at low frequencies, between 0.1 and 0.5Hz, peaking at 0.16Hz, e.g.

[38] noted the impact of peripheral vision on perception of motion, showing that having peripheral vision of a projection screen displaying vehicle motion caused greater visually-induced motion sickness.

Revisiting the sensory re-arrangement theory, consider a person suffering from motion sickness during a car journey.

The Future Of Motion Sickness In-Car Car motion can be categorised as having lateral oscillations (rolls), rotational changes in direction (yaw), and vertical changes/oscillations (pitch), as well as accelerations/decelerations.

Secondly, existing drivers will be freed from the driving task, reclaiming approximately 368 person hours per year spent by drivers in England alone [17]) for entertainment and productivity on-the-move, such as reading, working, consuming audio-visual media, gaming, etc.

Indeed, proposals have been suggested to utilize the full space of the car for media consumption activities, such as a drop-down projector screen patented by Ford [15].

Mitigations, Treatments and Recovery With respect to car travel speciﬁcally, minimizing lateral oscillations (e.g.

For accelerations/decelerations and rotational movements, providing an artiﬁcial horizon can reduce motion sickness [74].

Vection & Visually Induced Motion Sickness In VR When considering VR HMDs in-motion, visually perceived motion must be considered.

For example, if the VR HMD wearer is stationary yet visually perceives their avatar walking or running through a virtual environment, this would have the potential to induce VIMS.

As discussed , disparity between what is visually and physically perceived is likely to induce motion sickness, and VR HMD use in-motion offers up new ways in which this disparity might occur: Motion sickness / inverse vection An illusion of stability where the VR user may physically perceive motion whilst visually perceiving a stable virtual environment; Contradictory vection An illusion of self-motion conveyed through VR that contradicts perceived physical motion, e.g.

perceiving a car acceleration as a small, subtle movement instead of as absolute velocity, or increasing the visual magnitude of the acceleration to exhilarate.

viewing content which requires constant and rapid changes in gaze orientation, compared to content which is stable or whose orientation or position is physically manipulated by the user (e.g.

Thus, careful consideration must be given as to what particular form of motion conﬂict is examined, and how it is physically enacted.

Existing Support For VR HMD Use In-Motion There has been little recent work looking at VR HMD use in-motion with the current generation of consumer headsets.

[73] as part of the VR-Hyperspace project examined the effect of turbulent motions on VR HMD users in a ﬂight simulator, using an Oculus Rift DK 1 to prototype VR use as an aeroplane passenger as part of an examination of future entertainment options in-ﬂight.

Indeed, VR HMDs have seen recent deployment in real-world ﬂights as standard, most notably by Qantas[64].

Currently, VR HMDs are heavily reliant on high frequency, low latency inertial measurement units (IMUs) to accurately track the wearer’s head to provide dynamically updating displays.

This is the case for both existing mobile HMDs (e.g.

the Samsung Gear VR, which supports rotational movement only) and PC-based headsets (e.g.

positionally tracked devices such as the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift).

Gyroscopes are typically used as part of a sensor fusion approach, alongside accelerometers and magnetometers for accurate 3 DOF rotational tracking, external beacons and/or cameras for 6 DOF positional tracking [2], to track the movement of the headset.

This reliance on gyroscopes means that when used in-motion, viewing is inﬂuenced by orientation changes caused by transportation (e.g.

However, positionally-tracked VR HMDs will in the future be able to maintain stable viewing inmotion, meaning the VR view of the world need only react to movement by the user, and not the vehicle.

This can already be seen in highly controlled scenarios, where the external motion of the VR HMD is known in advance, such as in the case of VR rollercoasters where users experience synchronized virtual and physical representations of the ride [77].

Consequently, both existing VR HMDs (which interpret vehicle movements as head movements) and future positionally-tracked VR HMDs (which could ignore external movements) merit consideration with respect to sickness incidence in-motion.

Given this, the ﬁrst problem we investigated was motion sickness incidence due to VR HMD use in-motion to provide a baseline, which is missing from the literature.

Speciﬁcally, we looked at both VR HMDs that interpret the turning of a vehicle as part of the user’s head movement, and future VR HMDs that have a stable frame of reference with respect to vehicle movement.

We then examined how motion cues could be delivered to users in combination with a virtual environment, utilizing the sensitivity of peripheral vision, to see what effect this might have on motion sickness and immersion.

We could recreate an ecologically valid driving experience, of particular relevance to autonomous cars and public transport, and examine the effects of real-world motion cues, speciﬁcally rotations and accelerations/decelerations, over a set route.

Our aims were to examine: • VR HMDs where all rotations affect VR viewing orientation, regardless of whether they occurred through user head movements or vehicle motion; • Future positionally-tracked VR HMDs that can compensate, correct for or ignore external vehicle rotation; • The utility of peripheral visual motion cues to give some sense of external vehicle motion.
