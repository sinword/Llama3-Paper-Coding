Immersive HMDs are becoming everyday consumer items and, as they offer new possibilities for entertainment and productivity, people will want to use them during travel in, for example, autonomous cars.
Whilst VR HMDs restrict visual perception of motion, they could also render it virtually, potentially alleviating sensory conﬂict.
To study this problem, we conducted the ﬁrst on-road and in motion study to systematically investigate the effects of various visual presentations of the real-world motion of a car on the sickness and immersion of VR HMD wearing passengers.

Entertainment and productivity options are limited to displays signiﬁcantly smaller than those in the home or ofﬁce (e.g.
phones, tablets, laptops, dashboards and rear-seat systems [81]).
Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) have the potential to signiﬁcantly expand the display space, enabling immersive entertainment and workspaces that go beyond the physical limitations of the car interior.
Problematically, VR HMDs also occlude visual perception of reality [44, 6] and thus the car’s motion, and are likely to lead to sensory mismatch and, consequently, motion sickness.
However, assuming the orientation and velocity of the vehicle can be tracked at low latency, HMDs have the potential to portray the vehicle motion virtually.
VR and AR HMDs are capable of conveying the motion of the vehicle at all times, from all viewing angles.
This paper examines VR HMD use in-car, in-motion for the ﬁrst time.
We examine this both for existing consumer VR HMDs that interpret rotations of the car as rotations of the HMD, and future positionally-tracked HMDs that do not.
New baselines for VR motion sickness in-car are established and guidelines for future experimentation are provided, before we ﬁnally explore the further research required to enable comfortable VR HMD use in-motion.
RELATED RESEARCH Motion Sickness Motion sickness refers to illness arising from a person being within a motion environment, such as a moving vehicle [59].
describes as motion-sensitive input signals [3].
Lateral (bumps and undulations in a car ride) and vertical oscillations (at low frequencies, between 0.1 and 0.5Hz, peaking at 0.16Hz, e.g.
[38] noted the impact of peripheral vision on perception of motion, showing that having peripheral vision of a projection screen displaying vehicle motion caused greater visually-induced motion sickness.
The Future Of Motion Sickness In-Car Car motion can be categorised as having lateral oscillations (rolls), rotational changes in direction (yaw), and vertical changes/oscillations (pitch), as well as accelerations/decelerations.
Secondly, existing drivers will be freed from the driving task, reclaiming approximately 368 person hours per year spent by drivers in England alone [17]) for entertainment and productivity on-the-move, such as reading, working, consuming audio-visual media, gaming, etc.
Indeed, proposals have been suggested to utilize the full space of the car for media consumption activities, such as a drop-down projector screen patented by Ford [15].
Mitigations, Treatments and Recovery With respect to car travel speciﬁcally, minimizing lateral oscillations (e.g.
Vection & Visually Induced Motion Sickness In VR When considering VR HMDs in-motion, visually perceived motion must be considered.
For example, if the VR HMD wearer is stationary yet visually perceives their avatar walking or running through a virtual environment, this would have the potential to induce VIMS.

Thus, careful consideration must be given as to what particular form of motion conﬂict is examined, and how it is physically enacted.
Existing Support For VR HMD Use In-Motion There has been little recent work looking at VR HMD use in-motion with the current generation of consumer headsets.
[73] as part of the VR-Hyperspace project examined the effect of turbulent motions on VR HMD users in a ﬂight simulator, using an Oculus Rift DK 1 to prototype VR use as an aeroplane passenger as part of an examination of future entertainment options in-ﬂight.
Indeed, VR HMDs have seen recent deployment in real-world ﬂights as standard, most notably by Qantas[64].
Currently, VR HMDs are heavily reliant on high frequency, low latency inertial measurement units (IMUs) to accurately track the wearer’s head to provide dynamically updating displays.
This is the case for both existing mobile HMDs (e.g.
the Samsung Gear VR, which supports rotational movement only) and PC-based headsets (e.g.
positionally tracked devices such as the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift).
Gyroscopes are typically used as part of a sensor fusion approach, alongside accelerometers and magnetometers for accurate 3 DOF rotational tracking, external beacons and/or cameras for 6 DOF positional tracking [2], to track the movement of the headset.
This reliance on gyroscopes means that when used in-motion, viewing is inﬂuenced by orientation changes caused by transportation (e.g.
This can already be seen in highly controlled scenarios, where the external motion of the VR HMD is known in advance, such as in the case of VR rollercoasters where users experience synchronized virtual and physical representations of the ride [77].
Consequently, both existing VR HMDs (which interpret vehicle movements as head movements) and future positionally-tracked VR HMDs (which could ignore external movements) merit consideration with respect to sickness incidence in-motion.
Outcomes From Literature Review Users of VR HMDs in motion, engaging in interactive environments where their visual perception of motion may not be aligned with their physically perceived motion, may exhibit some degree of motion sickness.
This is likely to make HMDs very difﬁcult to use in cars for many people and thus the beneﬁts offered by autonomous vehicles cannot be taken advantage of.
Given this, the ﬁrst problem we investigated was motion sickness incidence due to VR HMD use in-motion to provide a baseline, which is missing from the literature.
Speciﬁcally, we looked at both VR HMDs that interpret the turning of a vehicle as part of the user’s head movement, and future VR HMDs that have a stable frame of reference with respect to vehicle movement.
We could recreate an ecologically valid driving experience, of particular relevance to autonomous cars and public transport, and examine the effects of real-world motion cues, speciﬁcally rotations and accelerations/decelerations, over a set route.
Users were stationary, wearing a VR HMD, watching 360° video.
This was to get a baseline for standard simulator sickness; 2: Motion Only Baseline motion sickness.
This gave a baseline for motion sickness from just being driven in a car; 3: VR Motion Environment In-motion, wearing a VR HMD.
The motion of the car was synchronously portrayed in VR, with the HMD user perceiving themselves moving through a basic landscape.
This was to evaluate whether our sensing of motion matched what was physically perceived; 4: VR V+M In-motion, wearing a VR HMD, with all rotations (head movements and vehicle rotations) interpreted as head movements.
This conveyed turning of the car; 5: VR V+M with compensation In-motion, wearing a VR HMD, with compensatory rotations of the video counteracting vehicle rotations.

version 2.4.29, 60Hz).
To have the capability to both convey the motions of the car in VR, and counteract the rotations of the car, a Nexus 5 smartphone was used.
It was mounted to the car, with its gyroscope (sampled at 30Hz at a latency of ∼40ms) providing bearing changes.
It was also paired with an OBD2 device (OBDLink LX [72], ∼14Hz at a latency of 100ms) for capturing car velocity in real-time.
For communicating the car motion to the HMD, we used a SocketIO server over which both the Nexus 5 and S7-powered HMD communicated.
The study was conducted in a 2015 model Vauxhall Insignia, chosen both to minimize oscillations (through a modern suspension system) and provide a fast OBD2 link.
An initial gyroscope bearing was taken with users looking straight ahead whilst wearing the headset.
Subsequent changes in this bearing determined the direction of the forward vector in the motion environment, with velocity also portrayed.
Secondly, we stabilized the VR view with respect to car motion.
Given the black box sensor fusion of the VR HMD tracking, we chose to exploit the fact that 360° VR video is typically rendered on a sphere, using gyroscope readings to perform counterrotations of the sphere.
For this we used a shader effect combined with raycasting to determine the current video ﬁxation point, with alpha blending to combine the motion environment and the video.
It is important to note that this approach, whilst suited to a prototype system, had some drawbacks regarding gyroscope drift.
A gyroscope is subject to drift over time and motion.
In the case of the Gear VR, a combination of gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer are used to retain a relatively accurate bearing.
However, magnetometer readings are unreliable in-motion, due to variances in the magnetic ﬁeld and the environment.
We designed a mechanism to allow users to re-orient the system, taking a new bearing for the forward vector and resetting the Gear VR tracking.
To do this, users interacted with the Gear VR touchpad, located on the right side of the headset.
This level was chosen as we did not have an understanding of the magnitude of the sickness effects of VR HMD use in motion and thus could not ethically examine more susceptible participants at this point.
Changes were indicated in real-time by participants using forward and backward swipes of the Gear VR touchpad, which would temporarily present the scale over the VR content.
Finally, users were asked to rank the VR Video In-Motion conditions (4–6) in order of preference, before taking part in a short interview.
However, these durations were problematic for our study given the unknown magnitude of sickness effects of VR HMD-use in motion.
To provide consistent and ecologically valid motion stimuli, laps of a quiet, predominantly one-way road system with no trafﬁc lights were undertaken.
0.86km test route velocity proﬁle, as captured throughout the study across participants using GPS and OBD2 velocity.
Three VR video clips were used, chosen on the basis of containing no movement, portraying stationary events in 360° [51, 62, 79], and played in the same order for every condition.
The generally low presence scores suggest this metric was confounded by the relatively low presence of the Gear VR HMD and the 360° video content.

You can look around in the car with the headset on, but it takes quite a lot of effort to see what’s directly behind you.
Interactions in Virtual Reality CHI 2017, May 6–11, 2017, Denver, CO, USA 5662 Peripheral Motion Provides Comfort For Some For Condition 6, three participants speciﬁcally noted that perceiving peripheral motion provided comfort, with 7 participants noting some preference for peripheral cues: P8: You’re very much aware that OK we are moving, we are turning, I’m very aware of what the car is doing.
Discontinuities Are Disruptive Two users noted that discontinuities between the VR motion environment and their perception of the physical world were particularly off-putting, with the VR content not adequately reﬂecting the changing environment around them: P6: When the sun did hit me, that was a bit confusing.
This suggests that, given a VR HMD that can counteract vehicle rotations, for these users VR in-motion is useable (albeit for the short duration examined).
VR In-Motion Was Problematic For Many For the majority of participants, sickness exceeded what would be considered acceptable for a motion simulator [37].
Our results demonstrate that there are signiﬁcant problems regarding VR HMD use in-motion that need to be overcome to make VR in-motion usable for the general population.
The latency of the gyroscope and OBD2 link, the gyroscopic drift (∼20° per min), the necessity for user resets of the forward vector (∼once per lap, mean=4.9, SD=2.4) and the lack of conveyance of oscillations could all contribute to a, likely modest, increase in sickness.
Consequently, we recommend that VR HMDs supporting positional tracking be used in-motion if possible.
GPS and gyroscope, periodic resets of orientation, marker tracking), some form of positional tracking appears preferable.
Problematically, consumer HMDs with positional tracking currently fuse both optical tracking and IMU data, meaning there is a reliance on gyroscopes which would make their immediate deployment in-car difﬁcult.
duration of stimulii; the effectiveness of interventions over time; characteristics of the route, vehicle and motion experienced; different forms of vection (see Section 2.2); differing motion and simulator sickness susceptibilities; the speciﬁcations of the HMD; age and user demographics; and the virtual content being experienced.
However, this implementation was limited by the technology.
The Gear VR HMD has a ﬁeld of view (FOV) of ∼96°; of this, our peripheral display took over ±10° from the edge.
Consequently, any expansion in VR FOV (e.g.
HMDs with high FOV lenses [82] or sparse peripheral displays [83]) would allow for further exploration of the effectiveness of conveying motion through the mid-to-far periphery of the eye.
We used a basic VR landscape to portray motion to maintain 60Hz when rendered in conjunction with video content.
Motion could be incorporated implicitly into VR (as with the Gear VR and Condition 4), by design (as part of a game), or generically for any content (e.g.
Manipulating the VR view to induce anticipatory actions might also help prevent motion sickness.
As an example, a VR display that tilted content so users had to match the tilt to continue reading might mimic these results.
Such effects might make VR HMDs, and notably also AR HMDs, ideally suited to facilitating entertainment and work whilst preventing motion sickness in autonomous cars and other transportation, where the environment might lead to sensory conﬂict and consequently motion sickness [20].
For example, Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) [11] has the capability to alter our physical perception of motion and has been applied to the problem of vection [56], whilst other devices (e.g.
These could be used to counteract physically perceived motion.
For private spaces such as cars, provided there is sufﬁcient trust [65] in the vehicle, then VR HMD use is more straightforward.
AR HMDs may be more acceptable here and research into solutions across mixed-reality HMDs should be investigated.
One way to do this is with VR and AR HMDs.
Given this motivation, this paper has, for the ﬁrst time, examined the usability of VR HMDs in-car.
Our results suggest that there is, as-yet, no universal solution for minimizing sickness from VR HMD use in-motion, however we have begun to explore how different solutions can make VR HMDs usable in transit.
